# Tkinter-project
Python GUI Assignment (tkinter)
This is a follow up assignment to the Python Datascience assignment which we have already completed. In this assignment we  designed a GUI using tkinter which  have the following overall functionality:

The GUI would provide the user to select a file from the computer.
It has a dropdown menu to toggle between two output options: Segmentation and Bounding-box
If Segmentation is selected then it should show the segmentation map of the selected image file along with the original image file side-by-side.
For Bounding-box it should display the bounding boxes instead of the segmentation maps.
We obtained the segmentation maps and the bounding boxes by taking help from the previous assignment .
